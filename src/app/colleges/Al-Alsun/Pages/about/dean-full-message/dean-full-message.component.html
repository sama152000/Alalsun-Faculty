            <p class="greeting">
              Dear students, esteemed faculty members, teaching assistants, administrative staff of the faculty, 
              and visitors to the official website of the Faculty of Al-Alsun, Luxor University.
              <span>
              <strong  class="welcome">Welcome to you all.</strong>

              </span>

            <p>
              The Faculty of Al-Alsun at Luxor University was established by Prime Ministerial Decree No. 2693 of 2016, 
              issued on 14 Muharram 1438 AH, corresponding to 15 October 2016.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The Faculty of Al-Alsun stands as a distinguished academic institution in the field of languages and translation. 
              It continues the legacy of Egypt's pioneers in translation, serving as a bridge between cultures and a vital tool 
              for transferring knowledge and sciences from around the world. The faculty comprises eight academic departments: 
              Arabic Language (with two tracks, Arabic for native speakers and Arabic for non-native speakers), English, French, 
              German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, and Chinese.
            </p>
            
            <p class="highlight">
              We believe that languages are not merely tools for communication but gateways to understanding other civilizations 
              and essential instruments for fostering intercultural dialogue and human connection.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In alignment with Egypt's Vision 2030, the Faculty is committed to providing high-quality academic education based 
              on modern curricula and innovative teaching methods. Our goal is to graduate qualified professionals equipped with 
              the linguistic and academic skills necessary to meet the demands of both local and international labor markets. 
              The Faculty also seeks to promote scientific research and offer advanced postgraduate programs that encourage 
              creativity and innovation in the fields of languages and translation.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We strive to foster a comprehensive learning environment by supporting student activities, enhancing academic 
              partnerships with local and international universities and research institutions, and offering practical training 
              opportunities that empower our students to gain real-world experience and succeed in their professional lives.
            </p>
            
            <p class="call-to-action">
              I call upon all of you, students, faculty, and staff—to actively contribute to the development of the Faculty, 
              and to work together in fulfilling its mission of serving society and advancing the standards of education and 
              scientific research.
