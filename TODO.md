# Sectors Backend Connection Plan

## Information Gathered
- Sectors service already has methods for all backend endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Components are using the service but may need verification for proper data flow
- Need to ensure add, edit, delete, and display flows work correctly with backend data

## Plan
- [x] Verify sectors service methods are properly connected to backend endpoints
- [x] Update add-sector component to ensure proper backend data flow
- [x] Update edit-sector component to ensure proper backend data flow
- [x] Update sectors-management component to ensure proper backend data flow
- [x] Update sectors-additional-information component to ensure proper backend data flow
- [x] Test add, edit, delete, and display flows

## Dependent Files to Edit
- src/app/features/colleges/Al-Alsun/Services/sectors.service.ts
- src/app/features/Dashboard/pages/dashboard/add-sector/add-sector.component.ts

- src/app/features/Dashboard/pages/dashboard/sectors-management/sectors-management.component.ts
- src/app/features/Dashboard/pages/dashboard/sectors-additional-information/sectors-additional-information.component.ts

## Followup Steps

- [x] Confirm data is fetched from backend and UI updates accordingly
